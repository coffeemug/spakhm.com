And third, if you take two vectors and add them, the result is in the space. Voila!\n",

For example, the fact that vector spaces contain zero isn't a part of the definition, but a consequence of the fact that in the _real_ definition additive inverse must be defined, so if $v$ is in the set then $-v$ must also be in the set, and since $v+(-v)=0$ then $0$ must be in the set. If you're curious you should by all means go and study the real thing, but it _will_ be considerably easier if you first develop an intuition first. So, I accept my penance, and for the moment we'll stick with \"contains zero\"."

        "Let's say you want to construct a 2D vector space. Meaning, you want a set of all points on a plane. How do you express that mathematically? A trivial way to do it would be to take two vectors, say $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$, scale each one to every conceivable length, and sum them. So for example $(2, 2) = 2(1, 0) + 2(0, 1)$. More generally you can express any vector $(x, y)$ as $x(1, 0) + y(0, 1)$. If you do it for every $x$ and $y$ you get every point in a 2D plane.\n",

        "This kind of thing happens so often in linear algebra that these ideas have names. A __linear combination__ is the sum of a bunch of scaled vectors. $2(1, 0) + 2(0, 1)$ is a linear combination because we take two vectors, scale them (both by 2 in this case), and sum them. A __span__ of some vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. The set $\\{x(1, 0)+y(0, 1)\\mid x\\in\\mathbb{R}, y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$ is the span of $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$. It contains every point on a 2D plane. Since it satisfies our three properties, it's a vector space.\n",

    "I'll talk about what matrix-vector multiplication _means_ in a moment. For now let's look at how the operation is defined. The precise definition of matrix-vector multiplication flows out of the notation above, so you never again have to look it up on wikipedia. If you need to multiply a matrix by a vector, say $\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "-1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\qvec{1 \\\\ 2}$, just recall that this is equivalent to the left side of the system of equations above. Before, we took the coefficients in the linear equation system and factored them out into a 2D array. Now we reverse the procedure-- take our 2D array and factor it back in as coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\qvec{\n",
    "0*1 + 1*2\\\\\n",
    "-1*1 - 0*2\n",
    "}=\\qvec{2 \\\\ -1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget how matrix-vector multiplication works, just remember that its definition flows out of the notation. Convert the matrix-vector multiplication notation back into the linear equation system notation again, and you get the matrix-vector multiplication formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may remember from high school that there is an operation defined on vectors called the dot product. The dot product is the sum of pairwise multiplication of elements of two vectors. E.g. $\\qvec{0, 1}\\cdot\\qvec{1, 2}=0*1 + 1*2=2$. The dot product of two vectors is an operation that represents the degree to which the two vectors point in the same direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's simple enough. But here is something curious. Another way to think of matrix-vector multiplication is by treating each row of a matrix as its own vector, and computing the dot products of these row vectors with the vector we're multiplying by (in this case $\\qvec{1, 2}$). How on earth does that work?! What does vector similarity have to do with linear equations, or with matrix-vector multiplication? I cannot answer this question quite yet. But we'll eventually build up to an answer in future posts."

    "Now let's look at what matrix-vector multiplication means. This blew my mind when I first learned about it. You can think of a matrix as a function, and you can think of multiplying a matrix by a vector as applying that function to the vector. So when you see $Ax$, autocomplete it in your head to \"calling some function $A$ with argument $x$\"."

    "The fact that $Ax=0$ denotes both the linear system in equation 1, and a call to a function $A$ with argument $x$ (getting the zero vector in return) leads to a curious insight about the relationship between high school math and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In high school you're given equations and asked to find their roots. We already established that a system of equations is equivalent to matrix-vector multiplication, which can be thought of as function application. And so, in high school you're _given_ a function $A$ along with its output, and asked to _find the inputs that match that output_. Programming is usually the exact opposite. In programming what you're _given_ is the shape of inputs and outputs, and your job is to _construct a function_ $A$ that converts inputs to desired outputs. The computer then executes the functions you construct, often at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it turns out that solving systems of linear equations in high school math classes and writing React code in your day job are two sides of the same coin! It's a complicated idea, so it takes a while to wrap your head around its implications (and its limitations). Illuminating this relationship in much more depth is another thing I hope to accomplish with these series of posts."

    "In highschool your teacher also gave you a bunch of rules for how to multiply matrices by each other, and then, if you're lucky, maybe explained what matrix-matrix multiplication means. I always thought it's a silly way of teaching it. Where did the rules come from? Did Moses bring them down from mount Sinai on stone tablets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, let's do it the sensible way and put the horse before the cart. Knowing what we know, if _we_ were tasked with defining matrix multiplication, what would we _want it to do_? What could be a reasonable definition?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen in the previous section that $A$ rotates its input vector clockwise by 90 degrees. Of course when we apply $A$, take the resulting vector, and apply $A$ again, _that_ gets rotated by 90 degrees. So applying $A$ twice rotates the _original_ input clockwise by 180 degrees. Mathematically, we can express it like this: $A(Ax)$. We perform matrix-vector multiplication $Ax$ which produces a vector, we take that vector, and perform matrix-vector multiplication on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally in math we want the multiplication operation to associate. It would be strage if the result of $2*(2*3)$ were different from $(2*2)*3$. So it's sensible to apply this principle to matrices and make _their_ multiplication associative. In other words, we want the following equation to be true:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(Ax)=(AA)x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $A(Ax)$ rotated $x$ clockwise by 180 degrees, ideally $AA$ would be a matrix that does exactly the same thing. To put it more generally, if matrix $A$ performs some operation, and another matrix $B$ performs a different operation, we want the matrix $M=AB$ to perform both of those operations one after another. A different way of putting it is that if we think of matrices as functions, we want matrix multiplication to act in the same way as function composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what matrix multiplication does. The derivation is a little bit messy, so instead of doing it inline I added it an [appendix](#appendix-matrix-matrix-multiplication-derivation) at the end of this post. If you forget why matrix-matrix multiplication is defined the way it is, you can always come back to this explanation."

    "\n",
    "Now here is something interesting. Since you can't perform a dot product of two vectors with different dimensions, for matrix-vector multiplication to work the number of elements in $\\qvec{1, 2}$ must be equal to the number of columns in $M$. Switching to thinking of $M$ as a function, _we've now learned something about the type of its input_. $M$'s arguments _must_ be vectors of two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite is true for $M$'s rows. Because we perform a dot product of $\\qvec{1, 2}$ with every row of $M$ and $M$ has three rows, the output vector must necessarily have three elements. And so, the number of rows in $M$ tells us about the type of its output.\n",

    "Now let's consider how types for matrix multiplication work. Suppose we have a different matrix $N$, and we'd like to multiply $N$ by $M$. What must the type of the matrix $N$ be? Well, if we look at a term $NMx$, $M$'s output becomes $N$'s input. Thefore, $N$'s input and $M$'s output must be of the same type. In other words, $N$'s number of columns must be the same as $M$'s number of rows:\n",

    "When you think about which matrices can and cannot be multiplied by each other, it's actually quite simple-- the output of one matrix (its rows) must have the same dimension as the input of another (its columns). If you get confused about that, perhaps writing it out in typescript notation will help!"
